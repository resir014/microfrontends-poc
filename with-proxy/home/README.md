# nextjs-typescript-quickstart

> Get started on Next.js with TypeScript in seconds.

This is an example setup of Next.js building on top of the [official TypeScript example](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/master/examples/with-typescript). It adds the following:

- Support for TS' `baseUrl` with `babel-plugin-module-resolver`
- Simple styling structure with `styled-jsx`
- Basic TSLint and Prettier setup
- TypeScript typechecking as part of `test` script (ready to plug into any CI)
